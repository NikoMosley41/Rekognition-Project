*AWS Rekognition Label Detection*

This project uses AWS Rekognition to identify and label objects within an image stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. It includes code to detect labels and display them with bounding boxes around recognized items. This is particularly useful for automated image analysis, such as identifying specific objects in images or categorizing images based on content.

*Project Overview:*

The script in this project performs the following tasks:

Connects to AWS Rekognition to detect labels within an image.
Loads the image from an S3 bucket.
Displays label information along with bounding boxes around detected objects, using matplotlib and Pillow.
